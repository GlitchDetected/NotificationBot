## Funding
NotificationBot is owned, developed, and maintained by one person. I, [GlitchDetected](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ), plan, develop, maintain, host and fund the project alone. I would be very grateful if you could support my work with a server boost on [discord.gg/randomdevelopment](https://discord.gg/GNdJMJCBdu)

## Security
[GlitchDetected](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ), the one and only developer of NotificationBot, develops and maintains the tools and entire codebase. Therefore, there is always a risk of security vulnerabilities. You are welcome to search for and report bugs and vulnerabilities in the codebase, tools and APIs, as long as you do not gain any advantage, cause us any harm, abuse the system/servers, disrupt services or impact our users. Do not disclose the issue to third parties until it is resolved. Please report any issues to `@glitchdetected` or on our [support server](https://discord.gg/GNdJMJCBdu) on Discord.
